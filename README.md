## Working

### CLI Tool

STACKD provides a command-line interface where users can quickly scaffold a full-stack project by answering a few prompts. It generates a structured codebase with backend, frontend, and database configurations pre-integrated.

### Configuration-Based Setup

STACKD offers a guided setup process where users can specify:\
‚úÖ Project Name\
‚úÖ Frontend & Backend Tech Stack (Next.js, React, Angular, Express, etc.)\
‚úÖ Database & ORM (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Prisma, TypeORM, etc.)\
‚úÖ Authentication Method (OAuth, JWT, etc.)\
‚úÖ UI Library (Tailwind CSS, ShadCN)

## Features

### Customizable Project Setup

STACKD allows developers to select the tech stack and configurations best suited for their project, ensuring a tailored development experience.

### Live Terminal Logs in GUI

The GUI interface provides real-time logs from the CLI execution, helping users track progress in a visually appealing manner.


## STACKD is ideal for:

‚úÖ Individual Developers ‚Äì Quickly scaffold full-stack apps without worrying about setup.\
‚úÖ Startup Teams ‚Äì Standardize tech stack and reduce setup time for new projects.\
‚úÖ Software Engineering Teams ‚Äì Maintain a consistent structure across multiple projects.\
‚úÖ Hackathon Participants ‚Äì Set up a ready-to-use environment instantly.\
‚úÖ Educators & Students ‚Äì Learn best practices in full-stack development through auto-generated projects.


### Core Stack

- *Frontend:* React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN
- *Backend:* Node.js, Express.js, Django, NestJS
- *Database:* PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- *Authentication:* OAuth, JWT
  
## Additional Stacks That Can Be Implemented

- *Chalk* ‚Äì Provides colorful logs in the CLI
- *React & TypeScript* ‚Äì For the GUI component


## Installation & Setup  

### CLI Tool  

## To scaffold a new full-stack project, run:  
```sh
npm create @shivasankaran18/stackd new proj-name
```
This will prompt you with setup questions and generate the project with the selected configurations.

### Web Tool
## To launch the web-based setup tool locally, use:

``` sh
npx @shivasankaran18/create-stackd setup
```




## Architecture

### CLI Tool Architecture

STACKD follows a modular architecture where the CLI interacts with the backend services to fetch configurations and generate the project structure.

#### Data Flow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User selects configurations in the CLI\
2Ô∏è‚É£ STACKD processes selections and generates the project\
3Ô∏è‚É£ Live logs are displayed in both CLI & GUI\
4Ô∏è‚É£ The generated project is ready for development

### Backend Architecture

STACKD has a lightweight backend that processes configuration requests and handles GUI interactions.

#### Data Flow:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The GUI sends configuration data to the backend\
2Ô∏è‚É£ The backend triggers the project generation script\
3Ô∏è‚É£ The generated project is pushed to the specified directory
