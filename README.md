## Working

### CLI Tool

STACKD provides a command-line interface where users can quickly scaffold a full-stack project by answering a few prompts. It generates a structured codebase with backend, frontend, and database configurations pre-integrated.

### Configuration-Based Setup

STACKD offers a guided setup process where users can specify:\
✅ Project Name\
✅ Frontend & Backend Tech Stack (Next.js, React, Angular, Express, etc.)\
✅ Database & ORM (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Prisma, TypeORM, etc.)\
✅ Authentication Method (OAuth, JWT, etc.)\
✅ UI Library (Tailwind CSS, ShadCN)

## Features

### Customizable Project Setup

STACKD allows developers to select the tech stack and configurations best suited for their project, ensuring a tailored development experience.

### Live Terminal Logs in GUI

The GUI interface provides real-time logs from the CLI execution, helping users track progress in a visually appealing manner.


## STACKD is ideal for:

✅ Individual Developers – Quickly scaffold full-stack apps without worrying about setup.\
✅ Startup Teams – Standardize tech stack and reduce setup time for new projects.\
✅ Software Engineering Teams – Maintain a consistent structure across multiple projects.\
✅ Hackathon Participants – Set up a ready-to-use environment instantly.\
✅ Educators & Students – Learn best practices in full-stack development through auto-generated projects.


### Core Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Django, NestJS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Authentication:** OAuth, JWT
  
## Additional Stacks That Can Be Implemented

- **Chalk** – Provides colorful logs in the CLI
- **React & TypeScript** – For the GUI component


## Installation & Setup  

### CLI Tool  

## To scaffold a new full-stack project, run:  
```sh
npm create @shivasankaran18/stackd new proj-name
```
This will prompt you with setup questions and generate the project with the selected configurations.

### Web Tool
## To launch the web-based setup tool locally, use:

```sh
npx @shivasankaran18/create-stackd setup
```




## Architecture

### CLI Tool Architecture

STACKD follows a modular architecture where the CLI interacts with the backend services to fetch configurations and generate the project structure.

#### Data Flow:

1️⃣ User selects configurations in the CLI\
2️⃣ STACKD processes selections and generates the project\
3️⃣ Live logs are displayed in both CLI & GUI\
4️⃣ The generated project is ready for development

### Backend Architecture

STACKD has a lightweight backend that processes configuration requests and handles GUI interactions.

#### Data Flow:

1️⃣ The GUI sends configuration data to the backend\
2️⃣ The backend triggers the project generation script\
3️⃣ The generated project is pushed to the specified directory
