# STACKD - Full-Stack Scaffolding Tool

STACKD (Abbreviation TBD) is an open-source scaffolding tool that simplifies the process of setting up a full-stack web application. It allows developers to generate a project with pre-configured frontend, backend, database, authentication, and other essential components in just a few clicks.

## üí° Motivation

We got the motive to build this application because every time me and my team went for a hackathon, it used to take a lot of time to set up the project with basic things like frontend, UI setup, backend, ORM connection, authentication, and other configurations. People in the work environment also struggle with this, so we came up with this idea. STACKD allows programmers to jump directly into coding instead of spending time on tedious setup tasks.
